Oseem is an addon to augment Reisenjima equipment.
It is entirely controlled by GUI, with no typed commands or configuration files.
To use:
-Load the addon.
-Trade an item to Oseem.
-Set any minimum required augments, adjust general settings, click start.
-If an augment meeting minimum required augments appears, the addon will stop augmenting and await input.
-The pause button will prevent additional augments in the same way as having hit a matching augment, allowing you time to consider your options.
-The pause button will not work after the augment delay bar is empty.  If you plan to pause, I recommend setting augment delay high enough to allow yourself time to do so.
-You can set no required options, which will require user action for each augment, if you prefer to manually decide but want the addon's interface.

Warning: Do not try to talk to any NPC or run away after trading an item, you may hard lock your client as the server still believes you are in a menu.  Always exit via the buttons in the addon's GUI prior to doing anything else.
