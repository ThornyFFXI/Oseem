# Oseem
Oseem is an addon to augment Reisenjima equipment.<br>
It is entirely controlled by GUI, with no configuration files and only one typed command.<br>
If you end up with the window offscreen, you can type **/oseem reset** to return it to the top left corner.

# Instructions
1. Load the addon.
2. Trade an item to Oseem.
3. Set any minimum required augments, adjust general settings, click start.
4. Always use the quit buttons in the GUI to exit menu when stopping before out of stones.

# Notes
* If an augment meeting minimum required augments appears, the addon will stop augmenting and await input.
* The pause button will prevent additional augments in the same way as having hit a matching augment, allowing you time to consider your options.
* The pause button will not work after the augment delay bar is empty.  If you plan to pause, I recommend setting augment delay high enough to allow yourself time to do so.
* You can set no required options, which will require user action for each augment, if you prefer to manually decide but want the addon's interface.

# Warning: Do not try to talk to any NPC or run away after trading an item, you may hard lock your client as the server still believes you are in a menu.  Always exit via the buttons in the addon's GUI prior to doing anything else.
